\section{API Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The MSI API's are provided in the file ``\texttt{msi.h}". Throughout this section, unless specified, DOF, matrix row and column ID's are specified by a local ID. A word ``\emph{global}" in a function name indicates that the function involves global operation or global data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Naming Convention}

MSI API function name consists of three words connected with `$\_$'.

\begin{itemize}
\item the first word is ``msi"
\item the second word is an operation target. If the operation target is system-wide, the operation target is ommited. For instance, the function name which initializes the MSI service consists of two words: \emph{msi}$\_$\emph{start}.
\item the third word is the operation description starting with a verb. For example, the function \emph{msi}$\_$\emph{matrix}$\_$\emph{getNumIter} returns the number of iterations in the solve operation. 
\end{itemize}

The following are operation targets used in the second word.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{field}: the api is performed on a field object
\item \textit{matrix}: the api is performed on a Petsc matrix
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abbreviation}

Abbreviations may be used in API naming. See \textit{http://scorec.rpi.edu/wiki/Abbriviations} for more information.

\subsection{Data Types and Classes}

For a geometry, partition and mesh model, the term \emph{instance} is used to indicate the model data existing on each process. For example, a mesh instance on process \emph{i} means a pointer to a mesh data structure on process \emph{i}, in which all mesh entities on process \emph{i} are contained and from which they are accessible. For all other data such as field and matrix, the term \emph{handle} is used to indicate the pointer to the data. For example, a matrix handle means a pointer to the matrix. The predefined data type has a prefix \emph{p} to indicate the pointer data type.

The following are predefined data types used in the interface function parameters.

\begin{tabular}{lp{14cm}}	
	pMesh  & 	a mesh instance (defined in ``\texttt{pumi.h}")\\
        pMeshEnt & 	a mesh entity handle (defined in ``\texttt{pumi.h}")\\
        pField & 	a field handle (defined in ``\texttt{pumi.h}")\\
	pOwnership & 	a user-defined ownership handle (defined in ``\texttt{pumi.h}") \\
 	pMatrix &	a matrix handle \\
\end{tabular}	

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Enumeration Types}

The enumeration type for matrix type is:

\begin{verbatim}
    msi_matrix_type {
        MSI_MULTIPLY = 0 /* matrix for multiplication */,
        MSI_SOLVE      	 /* 1 - matrix for solve */
    }
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-1cm}\hspace{1cm}

The enumeration type for matrix status is:

\begin{verbatim}
    msi_matrix_status {
        MSI_NOT_FIXED = 0 /* matrix is modifiable */,
        MSI_FIXED         /* 1 - matrix is not modifiable */
    }
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-1cm}\hspace{1cm}

\subsection{Initialization and Finalization}

The functions initialize/finalize the MSI operations.

\begin{verbatim}
void msi_start(
    pMesh  /* in */  m, 
    pOwnership  /* in */  o=NULL, 
    pShape  /* in */  s=NULL)
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-.5cm}\hspace{1cm}
Given a mesh, an ownership handle, and a field shape handle, initialize MSI services for solver-PUMI interactions. The ownership and field shape are optional (default: $NULL$). Ownership rule determines the owner copy among duplicated mesh entity copies by partitioning or ghosting. If the ownership handle is $NULL$, the PUMI's default rule is used (a part with the minimum process rank is the owning part of duplicate copies). Field shape defines the node distribution where the coordinates and field values (DOF's) are stored. If the shape is \emph{NULL}, the field shape saved in mesh (returned by \texttt{pumi$\_$mesh$\_$getShape}) is used. If it is not \textit{NULL}, the field shape of the mesh is set to $s$.

Combining ownership rule and field shape, local/global node numbering are generated.
See PUMI User's Guide for more information on ownership rule, field shape and numberings.

Note that the following operations should be performed prior to this function.
\begin{itemize}
\item MPI initialization
\item Solver initialization (e.g. PetscInitialize)
\item PUMI initialization 
\item model and mesh loading
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
int msi_finalize()
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-.5cm}\hspace{1cm}
Finalize the MSI services and clears all internal data. Note that the following operations should follow to complete further finalizations.
\begin{itemize}
\item mesh deletion
\item PUMI finalization
\item Solver finalization (e.g. PetscFinalize)
\item MPI finalization
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Field}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The attributes of PUMI field are:
\begin{itemize}
\item field name: unique string 
\item field size: the number of field data per node
\item field type: \texttt{PUMI$\_$SCALAR} for a real number, \texttt{PUMI$\_$VECTOR} for real numbers of size 3, \texttt{PUMI$\_$MATRIX} for real numbers of size 9, and \texttt{PUMI$\_$PACKED} for real numbers of arbitrary size
\item shape function to specify node distribution. The default shape is \textit{Linear} where nodes are associated only with vertices.
\end{itemize}

To support solver with advanced features, MSI supports the field API's with multiple field variables per node and complex number. If not specified here, use the field API's \texttt{PUMI.h} for the rest of field operations.

\begin{verbatim}
pField msi_field_create (
    pMesh  /* in */  m,
    const char*  /* in */  field_name, 
    int  /* in */  nv, 
    int  /* in */  nd, 
    pShape  /* in */  s=NULL)
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-.5cm}\hspace{1cm}
Given a mesh instance, field name, the number of values per node ($nv$), the number of field data per value of node ($nd$), and a shape function, \emph{(i)} create a field for all nodes (owned, non-owned part boundary and ghost), \emph{(ii)} switch the memory space for field data to a contiguous array, and \emph{(iii)} initialize the field data. The \emph{size}, the number of field data per node is \textit{nv}$*$\textit{nd}. The size of contiguous array for each process is \textit{size}$*$\textit{nn} for real number and \textit{size}$*$\textit{nn}$*$2 for complex number, where \textit{nn} is the number of local nodes on each process. The field data type (real or complex) is determined at time of configuration. See Section~\ref{install} for how to configure MSI with complex number.

The field shape is optional (default: \textit{NULL}). If it is \textit{NULL}, the field shape of the mesh is used (a field shape returned by \texttt{pumi$\_$mesh$\_$getShape}).

 If $nv$ is 1, \texttt{msi$\_$field$\_$create (m, field$\_$name, nv, nd, s)} is equivalent to \texttt{pumi$\_$field$\_$create (m, field$\_$name, nd, PUMI$\_$PACKED, s)} followed by \texttt{pumi$\_$field$\_$freeze} and \texttt{pumi$\_$ment$\_$setField} with value $0$ for all nodes.

\begin{verbatim}
int msi_field_getNumVal (pField  /* in*/  f)
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-.5cm}\hspace{1cm}
Given a field handle, return the number of value per node, \textit{nv}. If the field was created with \texttt{pumi$\_$field$\_$create}, return 1.

\begin{verbatim}
int msi_field_getSize (pField  /* in*/  f)
\end{verbatim}\vspace{-.5cm}\hspace{1cm}
Given a field handle, return the field size, \textit{nv}$*$\textit{nd}.
